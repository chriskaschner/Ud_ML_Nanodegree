# Project 1 - Boston Housing Prices

Apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. First explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. Then analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This will enable us to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, test this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to previously generated statistics..

## Requirements:
This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

Recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda) to install and manage Python, libraries, and environments.
