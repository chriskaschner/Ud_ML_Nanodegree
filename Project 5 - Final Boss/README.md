# Project 5 - Final Boss Battle

In this project I reimplement a pre-trained neural network by transferring weights.

# Requirements:
This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- et al.
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

Recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda) to install and manage Python, libraries, and environments.
